What?
---
After a longish time without a blog it occured to me that I might want to give blogging another go.

This time instead of [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) I would take a look at [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

Privacy

* I've added no tracking to the blog and am not tracking any data relating to visits.
* This project and the related blog are hosted with Github, so they have the means to track some data. From giving the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/) a glance they appear to gather fairly restrictive information,
but you may prefer to have a look at it yourself over my weakly informed opinion.

Contact

Neither this project nor the related blog are run in a commercial context.
Therefore it is my understanding that the typical Impressum Page for websites from Germany can be abridged.

Indepently of that you can contact Jakob Runge via these channels:

* Mail to ` runjak+blog [at] gmail.com`
